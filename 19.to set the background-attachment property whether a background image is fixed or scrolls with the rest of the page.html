<h1>Celebration of Diwali with Family without Crackers</h1>
<br>
<p>Diwali is my favorite festival of the year, and I celebrate it with lots of enthusiasm with my family members and friends. Diwali is called the festival of lights because we celebrate it by lighting lots of diyas and candles. It is a traditional and cultural festival celebrated by each and every Hindu person all over India and abroad. People decorate their houses with lots of candles and small clay oil lamps, indicating the victory of good over evil.

    Family members spend most of the day preparing the house (cleaning, decorating, etc.) to welcome the festival with a grand evening party. Neighbors, family members, and friends get collected at the evening party and enjoy the party with delicious Indian dishes, dance, music, etc., all through the night. Houses look very attractive in white wash, candle lights, and rangolis. High-pitch music and fireworks make the celebration more interesting.
    
    People go to their homes by taking off from their job, offices, and other work; students also booked their train around three months ago to easily go to their homes on Diwali festival because everyone wants to celebrate this festival with their family members in the home town. People enjoy the festival by feasting, bursting crackers, and enjoying the dance with family and friends.
    
    However, it prohibited doctors from getting outside and enjoying firecrackers, especially people suffering from lung or heart diseases, hypertension, diabetes, etc. Such people have to knock on the doctor’s door because of consuming high amounts of highly saturated food and sweets, lack of exercise, and pollution caused by crackers these days.</p>

        <p>With the Diwali celebration, there is an indirect increase in environmental pollution worldwide because of the bursting of various firecrackers during this festival. Such firecrackers are very dangerous as they release toxic pollutants like sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, etc., which get intermingled into the air and cause a variety of ailments like asthma, bronchitis, hypertension, etc. It affects people of all age groups; however, those who already suffer from any ailment. Together with human beings, it also affects the lives of animals, birds, and other living beings due to air and noise pollution.</p>
